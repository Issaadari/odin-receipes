        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mesure <strong>175g plain flour</strong> in a medium bowl and add 1 tsp salt flakes.</li>
            <li>Crack <strong>2 eggs</strong> into the flour and add a little of the <strong>Milk</strong>.</li>
            <li>Whisk together a thick paste. Try to beat out as many of the lumps as possible.</li>
            <li>Add milk a little at time until all combined.</li>
            <li>Take a frying pan and put onto a high heat until it is just starting to smoke then turn the heat
                down to medium.</li>
            <li>Spray 3 to 4 sprays of <strong>Spray Oil</strong> into the pan, trying to coat the whole surface.</li>
            <li>Take a ledleful of batter and pour into the center of the pan with your dominant
                handle whilst starting to swirl the batter around the with your other hand.</li>
            <li>When the batter is no longer liquid on top of the pancake (only 30s or so),
                use a flat spatula to gently tease the pancake away from the pan. It is 
                ready to flip once the pancake can be shaken around the pan loosely.
            </li>
            <li>Flip the pancake. You can either do this by practising throwing the pancake up
                in the air and catching it. Or, if you're not trying to show off, use the spatula.
            </li>
            <li>Give the pancake 30s or so on the second side.</li>
            <li>Move the pancake to a plat and put in the warm owen.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the rest of the batter until it is used up. Add each cooked paancake
                to the plate in the oven as it is cooked.
            </li>

        </ol>
