    <h2>How to make omelette</h2>

    <p>In cuisine, an <strong>Omelette</strong> (also spelled omelet) is a dish 
        made from beaten <em>eggs</em>, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan
        (without stirring as in scrambled egg).
    </p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Beaten eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Season the beaten well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter in a non
            stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the pan ever so slightly from one side to another allow the
            eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook
            for about 20s then scrape a line through the middle with a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. Repeat once 
            or twice more until the egg has just set.
        </li>
        <li>At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like-some grated cheese,
            sliced ham, fresh herbs, sauted mushrooms or smoked salmon all work well.
            Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half with the 
            spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
